Open the project in an IDE (I am using IntelliJ) as a Maven Project. After the IDE builds the project, run Router.main() and visit the following [link](http://localhost:4567/hello) to see if the server is running. You should see current date time on the webpage.

The following openly available material was used (crediting to the authors):
1. The home webpage template has been taken from [Colorlib](https://colorlib.com/wp/).
2. The favicon is taken from [Flaticons](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/vectors-market).
